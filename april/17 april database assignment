1) What is a Database? Explain with an example on why should we need a database
  A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, management, and manipulation of that data. 
Databases are used to store, manage, and retrieve data in a systematic and organized manner.

Data Storage:They allow you to store large amounts of data in a structured format.
Data Retrieval: Databases enable you to retrieve specific pieces of data quickly and efficiently using queries. 
This is particularly useful for finding relevant information in large datasets.
Data Integrity: Databases can enforce data integrity by defining constraints and rules that ensure the accuracy and consistency of the stored data. 

2)Write a short note on File base storage system. Explain the major challenges of a File-based storage system

  it is represent the organizing and managinfg data where the information is stored in files and folder on the local storage media such as the harddrive.
File-Based Storage:same data we filled multiple files
File-Based Storage:here chances are there for file updated one file but not another one
File-Based Storage:it was challanging to restrict the specific part of the code
File-Based Storage:concurrency update lead to the data corruption
File-Based Storage:same data we filled multiple files

 3)What is DBMS? What was the need for DBMS?
DBMS is a software system that provides an organized and efficient way to store, manage, retrieve, and manipulate data. 
It serves as an intermediary between the application programs and the data stored in databases. 

*integrate with reporting,we can easily analyse and generate the report from data
*it was helpful to backup process
*it can avoid the dublicate so we can save the space
*it can have the capacity to have the secuirity

4) Explain 5 challenges of file-based storage system which was tackled by DBMS?

1.Data redundancy:
File-Based Storage:same data we filled multiple files
DBMS Solution: redundant data stored only once

2.Data incosistancy
File-Based Storage:here chances are there for file updated one file but not another one
DBMS Solution:here unique keys and referancial integrity present
File-Based Storage:here custom code are required,it was time consuming

3.Data access:
File-Based Storage:here custom code are required,it was time consuming
DBMS Solution:here SQL is present so it can retrive the data efficiently

4.Security and Access control:
File-Based Storage:it was challanging to restrict the specific part of the code
DBMS Solution:here user can assign the roles and permision

5.Concurrency and Transaction Management:
File-Based Storage:concurrency update lead to the data corruption
DBMS Solution:here multi user environment possible

5)
what is the  different types of classification in DBMS and explain them in depth?

data model classification:

data in a DBMS can be classified based on the data model used to structure it.
Relational Data Model: Data is organized into tables (relations) with rows (tuples) and columns (attributes). This model is the basis for Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), such as MySQL and PostgreSQL.
Document Data Model: Data is stored as documents, often in formats like JSON or XML.MongoDB is an example of a document-based DBMS.
Hierarchical Data Model: Data is organized in a tree-like structure, with parent-child relationships. 
Graph Data Model: Data is represented as nodes and edges, making it suitable for modeling complex relationships. e.x Neo4j 
Key-Value Data Model: Data is stored as key-value pairs, making it a simple and flexible way to store and retrieve data.e.x Redis 
Object-Oriented Data Model: Data is represented as objects with attributes and methods, which is useful for applications with complex data structures.

Data Structure Classification:
Data can be classified based on its structure, which refers to how the data is organized and stored. Common data structure classifications include:
Structured Data: Data with a well-defined schema and organized into tables or predefined structures.
Semi-Structured Data: Data that doesn't adhere to a strict schema but has some structure, such as JSON, XML, or NoSQL documents.
Unstructured Data: Data that lacks a predefined structure or schema, such as text, images, audio, and video files.
Binary Data: Data that is stored in a binary format, often as a sequence of bytes or bits.

Access Method Classification:
Data in a DBMS can be classified based on the method of access, which includes:
Indexed Data: Data is organized and accessed using indexes for efficient retrieval.
Sequential Data: Data is accessed in a linear or sequential order, typically used for batch processing.
Random Access Data: Data can be accessed directly, without the need to traverse 

6) What is the significance of Data modelling and explain the types of data modeling?
 data to facilitate efficient storage, retrieval, and processing of information

Communication:it convey the data requirement to the developers,database designers,stakeholder
 Business Understanding:well developed data modelling gives the understanding business
Secuirity:it give the protection to th  requirement one
 Data Integrity:it provides the accuracy and consistancy

Conceptual Data Modeling:focus one the essintial thing ,this on was early stage purpose
Logical Data Modeling:it was helpful to the undestanding of the data requirements without specifing the physical one
Physical Data Modeling:transfer the logical one to specific database system
Hierarchical Data Modeling:Represents data in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships.

7)Explain 3 schema architecture among with its advantages.

*single schema architecture:all data stored in single structure.
                           it is for small scale application.
*two-tier schema architecture:here user schema and system schema available, 
                              user schema contains the data that application users interact with directly, while the system schema contains metadata and system-related information.
*three-tier schema architecture: here user schema,logical schema and system schema available

Simplicity and Ease of Use: Single schema and two-tier schema architectures are relatively simple and easy to understand and manage, making them suitable for smaller applications with straightforward data requirements.
Security and Separation of Concerns: Two-tier and three-tier schema architectures allow for the separation of user data from system data, which can enhance security and data management.
