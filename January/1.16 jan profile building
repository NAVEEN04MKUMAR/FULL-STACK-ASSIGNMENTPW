They are responsible for the visual design, interactivity, and overall user experience, and their work directly impacts how users perceive and interact with a digital product.

User Interface (UI):
The primary goal of UI design is to make the interface visually appealing, intuitive, and easy to use.
Think of UI as the "skin" of the product, how it appears to the user and how they interact with it.
UI, or User Interface, focuses on the visual and interactive aspects of a design.
It's concerned with the look and feel of a product, website, or application.

User Experience (UX):
It's about the overall quality of the user's interaction with a product or system.
It considers not only the visual design (UI) but also the functionality, usability, accessibility, and how the user feels throughout the process.
UX design aims to create a positive and meaningful experience for the user

who is a frontend developer? Explain the roles and responsibilities in your own words
Collaboration: Front-end developers often work closely with designers, back-end developers, and other team members to ensure that the final product aligns with the project's requirements and goals.
Performance Optimization: Front-end developers work to optimize the performance of web pages by reducing loading times, minimizing HTTP requests, and following best practices for optimizing images and other assets.
styling: Front-end developers use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to style and format web pages. 
Responsive Design: Creating responsive websites that adapt to various screen sizes and devices (desktops, tablets, smartphones) is a key responsibility. 

who is a backend developer? Explain the roles and responsibilities in your own words
A backend developer, also known as a server-side developer, is a type of web developer responsible for creating and maintaining the server-side logic and infrastructure of websites and web applications.
Backend developers work behind the scenes, handling data processing, server management, and application functionality that is not directly visible to the user. 

1. Server-Side Logic: Backend developers write code that runs on the server.
This code handles tasks like data processing, authentication, and managing the database.
It's responsible for making sure the right data is delivered to the front-end (what the user sees) and that it's done efficiently.
2. Database Management: They design, maintain, and optimize databases that store and manage the application's data.
This includes creating, updating, and querying databases to retrieve or update information.
3. API Development: Backend developers create APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow the front-end (the user interface) to communicate with the backend.
APIs define how data can be requested, exchanged, and updated between the client and server.
