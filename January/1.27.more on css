1.Why is it called a pseudo-class?

:hover:
Selects and styles an element when the user hovers over it.
a:hover {
  color: red;
}

:first-child:
Selects and styles the first child element of its parent.
li:first-child {
  font-weight: bold;
}

:nth-child():
Selects and styles elements based on their position within a parent.
li:nth-child(odd) {
  background-color: lightgray;
}
:focus:

Selects and styles an element when it receives focus (e.g., when a form element is clicked).
input:focus {
  border: 2px solid blue;
}

2.What are gradients in CSS?

Linear Gradients:

Linear gradients create a transition effect along a straight line, typically from one color to another.
css
Copy code
/* Example of a linear gradient from red to blue */
.element {
  background: linear-gradient(to right, red, blue);
}
In this example, the linear gradient starts from the left (specified by to right) with the color red and transitions to blue.

Radial Gradients:
Radial gradients create a transition effect from the center of a shape to its edges.

.element {
  background: radial-gradient(yellow, green);
}
In this example, the radial gradient starts from the center and transitions from yellow to green.

Directional Gradients:
You can control the direction of a linear gradient by specifying keywords like to right, to left, to top, or to bottom.
.element {
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, pink, purple);
}

Multiple Color Stops:
Gradients can have multiple color stops, allowing for more complex color transitions.
.element {
  background: linear-gradient(to right, red, yellow, green, blue);
}
