1.Why do we start learning a programming language with “Hello World!
Motivation and Encouragement: Successfully running a "Hello, World!" program can be an encouraging first step for newcomers.
It gives them a sense of accomplishment and motivates them to continue learning and exploring the language.
Testing and Debugging: The "Hello, World!" program provides an opportunity to learn how to write, test, and debug code.
It helps beginners become familiar with the development workflow.
Syntax Demonstration: "Hello, World!" examples showcase the basic syntax and structure of a programming language.
They introduce concepts such as declaring variables, calling functions or methods, and formatting output.
Simplicity: "Hello, World!" is an extremely basic program that usually consists of only a few lines of code.
It serves as an easy and non-intimidating way for newcomers to get started with a new programming language without overwhelming them.

2.How is the use of comments and how do you write comments in HTML?

Debugging: Comments can help in debugging HTML code.When troubleshooting issues, developers can temporarily comment out or add comments to sections of code to isolate problems and identify the source of errors.
Communication: Comments provide a means for developers to communicate with each other.They can explain the reasoning behind certain design choices, discuss potential optimizations, or leave notes for other team members working on the project.
Temporary Removal: Comments allow you to temporarily remove or "comment out" a portion of code without deleting it.This is useful when you want to test how your web page behaves without a particular element or script.
Prevent Execution: comments can be used to prevent the execution of code.example, if we want to disable a script or style temporarily,we can enclose it in a comment block.

<!-- This is a comment. It won't be visible on the web page. -->

3.What are elements,tags and attributs and the diffence between them

Elements:
An element is composed of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag (in most cases).
Elements define the structure and content of a web page. They can represent headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, and more.
example:
<p>This is a paragraph element.</p>
<a href="https://www.example.com">This is a link element.</a>

Tags:
Tags are the HTML code used to mark the beginning and end of an element.
Tags can be either opening tags (e.g., <p>) or closing tags (e.g., </p>). Self-closing tags (e.g., <img>) do not have a closing tag because they don't enclose content.

Attributes:
Attributes provide additional information about an element and are placed inside the opening tag.
Attributes allow you to customize and enhance the behavior or presentation of an element.
Common attributes include src (for specifying the source of an image), href (for defining a link's destination), and class (for applying CSS styles).
Example:
<a href="https://www.example.com" title="Visit Example">This is a link element.</a>
<img src="image.jpg" alt="An example image">
