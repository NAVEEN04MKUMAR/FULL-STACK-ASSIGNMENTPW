1." What are the new things introduced in HTML5!?
New Semantic Elements:
<time> for representing dates and times.
<progress> for showing progress.
<meter> for displaying scalar measurements.

SVG and MathML Integration:
HTML5 supports Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) and Mathematical Markup Language (MathML) for improved vector graphics and mathematical notation on the web.

Drag and Drop:
The Drag and Drop API simplifies implementing drag-and-drop functionality in web applications.

WebSockets:
WebSockets provide real-time, bidirectional communication between the browser and server, allowing for interactive applications.

New Structural Elements:
<header>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, and <footer>: These elements help structure web content more semantically, making it easier for search engines and screen readers to understand the document's structure.

Multimedia Elements:
<audio> and <video>: These elements allow seamless embedding and playback of audio and video content without the need for third-party plugins like Flash.

2.what are the semantic tags?
Semantic tags in HTML are elements that provide meaning to the structure of a web page.
They help convey the intended purpose of different sections of the page to both browsers and assistive technologies (such as screen readers).
Semantic tags make it easier to understand the content's hierarchy and purpose. 



3.example of the sematic tags:
<header>:
The <header> element represents the introductory content or a container for a set of navigational links at the top of a web page or a section within a page. It typically includes elements like the site logo, site title, and navigation menus.
Example:
<header>
    <h1>My Website</h1>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
            <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
</header>

<main>:
The <main> element is used to represent the main content of the document. It should be unique within the document and exclude content like headers, footers, and sidebars. This tag helps screen readers and search engines identify the primary content.
Example:
<main>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is the main content of the page.</p>
</main>

<nav>:
The <nav> element represents a section of the page containing navigation links, typically used for site navigation menus. It distinguishes navigational links from other content on the page.
Example:
<nav>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
</nav>

<article>:
The <article> element represents a self-contained piece of content that can be distributed or reused independently, such as a blog post, news article, or a forum post.
Example:
<article>
    <h2>10 Tips for Web Development</h2>
    <p>Here are some valuable tips for web developers...</p>
</article>

<section>:
The <section> element defines a thematic grouping of content within a page. It's a versatile container for structuring content, but it doesn't imply any specific meaning on its own.
Example:
<section>
    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <p>Content of the first section.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <p>Content of the second section.</p>
</section>

<footer>:
The <footer> element represents the footer of a section or the page itself. It typically contains information like copyright notices, contact details, and links to related content.
Example:
<footer>
    <p>&copy; 2023 My Website</p>
    <p>Contact: info@mywebsite.com</p>
</footer>
Using semantic tags not only improves accessibility but also assists search engines in better understanding and ranking your content, which can have a positive impact on SEO.
Semantic HTML helps maintain a clear and well-structured document outline, making it easier for developers to maintain and style web pages.
