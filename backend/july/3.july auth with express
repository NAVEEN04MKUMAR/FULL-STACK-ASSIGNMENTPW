Building a Full-Stack User
Management System
Similar to Instagram

Full Stack Web Development

Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to create a full-stack user info and login system that resembles the
functionality of Instagram. The system will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, while the
back-end will be developed using Express.js and MongoDB.

Front-End Development:
a. Design a visually appealing user interface using HTML and CSS.
b. Create an intuitive user registration form that captures essential details like username, email, and password
& bio & Name
c. Develop a login form that authenticates users and verifies their credentials.
Back-End Development:
a. Use Express.js to handle HTTP requests and responses.
b. Set up a MongoDB database to store user information securely.
c. Implement user registration functionality by validating and saving user data to the database.
d. Develop a login mechanism that verifies user credentials against the stored data.
e: Generate JWT token and Store it into cache
Security:
a. Hash and salt user passwords before storing them in the database to enhance security.
b. Protect sensitive routes and ensure that only authenticated users can access them.
Documentation
a. Provide clear and concise documentation on how to set up and run the application.
Deliverables:
Complete source code of the front-end and back-end implementation.
A document containing instructions for setting up and running the system.
Note: You are encouraged to enhance the system beyond the specified requirements, add additional
features, and improve the user experience.

Backend:
“/signup” → create a signUp routes which takes {name,username,bio,email,password} as response
and hash password and then store data in database
“signupDataValidate” → create a middleware which checks if user has provided required data or not
based on that send response or move further
“/login” → create a login routes which takes {user,password} as response, generate jwt token and set to
cookie and response with success message
“loginDataValidate” → create a middleware which checks if user has provided required data or not
based on that send response or move further
